### Recent Progress

#### ✅ Completed in This Session
1. **Fixed all PageManager Tests** - All 45 tests now passing
   - Fixed "should detect need to move overflowing content" - properly mocked measurement container
   - Fixed "should handle errors in overflow processing gracefully" - added try/catch for expected error
   - Fixed "should handle missing content element" - tested at correct level with missing content

2. **StorageManager Tests** - Created and all 29 tests passing
   - Complete test coverage for auto-save functionality
   - Tests for document save/load with localStorage
   - Import/export functionality tests
   - Legacy format migration tests
   - Error handling and validation tests

3. **Test Data Fixtures** - Created comprehensive test fixtures
   - Sample documents (simple, multi-page, formatted, with TOC, legacy)
   - HTML and Markdown test data for import testing
   - Mock selection ranges and styles

4. **LineSpacingManager Tests** - Fixed all 30 tests
   - Previously rewrote tests to match actual implementation
   - Tests use correct CSS classes from Constants.js
   - Proper DOM mocking for all scenarios

### Next Steps

1. **High Priority**
   - Fix 3 remaining PageManager tests
   - Write unit tests for DocumentEngine
   - Increase code coverage to 80%

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Create integration tests for save/load functionality
   - Add tests for ContentEditor (focus on formatting commands)
   - Test export functionality (JSON, HTML, Markdown)

3. **Low Priority**
   - Add tests for UI components (Toolbar, TableOfContents)
   - Increase DOMUtils test coverage
   - Add StorageManager tests
   - Set up E2E testing framework

### Testing Infrastructure Status

- ✅ Babel configured for ES6 modules
- ✅ Coverage thresholds set (80% lines/statements)
- ✅ Mock setup for DOM APIs
- ✅ Webpack build system configured
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- ❌ No E2E test framework yet
- ❌ Integration tests not set up
